    //moveDir is multiplied by speed so we move at a decent pace
    //if the input button for jump is pressed then           
    //our moveDir.y is equal to our jump speed
    //regardless of if we are grounded or not the players moveDir.y is always affected by gravity timesed my time.deltaTime to normalize it
    //we then tell the character Controller that it is moving in a direction multiplied Time.deltaTime
